# Kinklist-Plus

**[Link to Kinklist-Plus](https://zowchi.github.io/kinklist-plus/)**

A kink list/fetish chart generator, adapted from [Kinklist](https://adhesivecheese.github.io/kinklist/) by [adhesivecheese](https://github.com/adhesivecheese/kinklist).

Kinklist-Plus adds several new features, such as:

- Flexible choices defined in the list format (no more hard-coded choices!)
- Choice descriptions to resolve any ambiguity when filling out lists
- List descriptions at the top of the page
- Dark Mode (and future themes support)
- "Find Incomplete" toggle to spot unfilled/missed kinks
- Some minor formatting fixes to Kinklist's built-in lists
- ...and more!

What started initially as a desire to have a "Kinklist but with small changes" ended up being a longer project.

Please enjoy.
