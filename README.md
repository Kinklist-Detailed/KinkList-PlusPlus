# Kinklist+

This is a kink list/fetish chart generator, forked from [Kinklist](https://adhesivecheese.github.io/kinklist/) by [adhesivecheese](https://github.com/adhesivecheese/kinklist). Original source code and concept created by [Goctionni](https://github.com/Goctionni/KinkList), all rights are reserved to them.

Kinklist+ adds several new features, such as:

- **Several themes** to choose from, including **Dark Mode** by default!
- **Customizable choices** defined in the list format (no more hard-coded choices)!
  - Optional descriptions for choices can be added as well.
- **Collapsible** categories!
- **List descriptions** at the top of the page!
- New **Find Incomplete** toggle to highlight unfilled kinks!
- Plenty of UI and formatting fixes, such as **ultrawide** and **improved mobile** support.
- ...and more!

What started initially as a desire to have a "Kinklist but with small changes" ended up being a longer project.

Please enjoy, and have fun.
